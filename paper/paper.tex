\begin{abstract} 
   We describe a new mechanism that leads to the destabilisation of
 non-axisymmetric waves in astrophysical discs with 
 an imposed radial temperature gradient. This might apply, for
 example, to the outer parts of protoplanetary discs. We use linear
 density wave theory 
 to show that non-axisymmetric perturbations generally do not conserve
 their angular momentum in the presence of a forced temperature
 gradient. This implies an exchange of angular momentum 
 between linear perturbations and the background disc. In particular, 
 when the disturbance is a low-frequency 
 trailing wave and the disc temperature decreases outwards, this 
 interaction is unstable and leads to the growth of the wave.  
 We demonstrate this phenomenon through numerical hydrodynamic
 simulations of locally isothermal discs in 2D using the FARGO
 code and in 3D with  the ZEUS-MP and PLUTO codes.  We consider
 radially structured discs with a self-gravitating region which remains
 stable in the absence of a temperature gradient. However,
 when a temperature gradient is imposed we observe exponential growth of a one-armed  
 spiral mode (azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$) with co-rotation radius 
 outside the bulk of the spiral arm, resulting in a nearly-stationary
 one-armed spiral pattern.  The development of this one-armed 
 spiral does not require the movement of the central star, as found in previous studies. 
 Because destabilisation by a forced temperature gradient does 
 not explicitly require disc self-gravity, we suggest this mechanism may also
 affect low-frequency one-armed oscillations in non-self-gravitating
 discs.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
An exciting development in the study of circumstellar 
discs is the direct observation of large-scale, non-axisymmetric
structures within them. These
include lopsided dust distributions 
\citep{marel13,fukagawa13,casassus13,isella13,perez14,follette14,plas14} and
spiral arms 
\citep{hashimoto11,muto12,boccaletti14,grady13,christiaens14,avenhaus14}. 

% planet is popular answer for spiral structure
The attractive explanation for asymmetries in circumstellar discs is
disc-planet interaction. In particular, spiral structures  
naturally arise from the gravitational interaction between a
planet and the gaseous protoplanetary disc it is embedded in
\citep[see, e.g.][for a recent review]{baruteau13b}. Thus, the
presence of spiral arms in circumstellar discs could be signposts of 
planet formation \citep[but see][]{juhasz14}.

% but also natural in GI.
Spiral arms are also  characteristic of global gravitational 
instability (GI)  in differentially rotating discs
\citep{goldreich65,laughlin96b,laughlin98,nelson98,lodato05,forgan11}. Large-scale 
spiral arms can provide significant angular momentum transport
necessary for mass accretion \citep{lynden-bell72,
  papaloizou91,balbus99,lodato04}, and spiral structures due to GI are
potentially observable with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array \citep{cossins10,dipierror14}. GI can
be expected in the earliest stages of circumstellar disc formation 
\citep{kratter10b,inutsuka10,tsukamoto13}, and may be possible in the
outer parts of the disc \citep{rafikov05,matzner05,kimura12}.  

Single-arm spirals, or eccentric modes, corresponding to perturbations 
with azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$, have received interest in 
the context of protoplanetary discs because of their global nature
\citep{adams89,heemskerk92,laughlin96,tremaine01,papaloizou02,hopkins10}. 
In the `SLING' mechanism proposed by \cite{shu90}, an $m=1$ 
  gravitational instability arises from the motion of the
central star induced by the one-armed perturbation, and requires a
massive disc \citep[the former may have observable consequences,
][]{michael10}.    


  In this work we identify a new mechanism that leads to the growth of
  one-armed spirals in astrophysical discs. We show
  that when the disc temperature is prescribed (called locally isothermal
  discs), the usual statement of the conservation of angular momentum
  for linear perturbations acquires a source term proportional to the
  temperature gradient. This permits angular momentum exchange between
  linear perturbations and the background disc. This `background
  torque' can destabilise low-frequency non-axisymmetric
  trailing waves when the disc temperature decreases outwards.       
  

 We employ direct hydrodynamic simulations using three different
  grid-based codes to demonstrate how this `background torque' 
  can lead to the growth of one-armed spirals in radially structured, 
  self-gravitating discs. This is despite the fact that our disc
  models do not meet the requirements for the `SLING' 
  mechanism. Although our numerical simulations consider
  self-gravitating discs, this `background torque' is generic for
  locally isothermal discs and its existence does not require
  disc self-gravity. Thus, the destabilisation effect we
  describe should also be applicable to non-self-gravitating discs.  


This paper is organised as follows. In \S\ref {model} we describe the system of interest
and list the governing equations. In \S\ref{wkb} we use linear theory  to show
  how a fixed temperature profile 
  can destabilise non-axisymmetric waves in discs. \S\ref{methods} describes
the numerical setup and hydrodynamic codes we use to 
  demonstrate the growth of one-armed spirals due to an imposed
  temperature gradient. Our
  simulation results are presented in  \S\ref{results2d} for two-dimensional (2D) 
  discs and in \S\ref{results3d} for three-dimensional (3D) discs, and we further
discuss them in \S\ref{discussions}. We summarise in \S\ref{summary}  
with some speculations for future work.
