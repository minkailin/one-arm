\section{Preliminary experiments}
Here we describe one numerical simulation from each code to give a
qualitative picture of disc evolution. In the next section, we analyse
2D simulations in more detail and explore parameter space.  

In these simulations we subject the disc to random perturbations in
cylindrical velocity,
\begin{align}\label{randpert}
  \frac{\delta v_R}{c_s} = \frac{\delta}{M}\times T(R) \sum_{m=1}^M\cos{m\phi},
\end{align}
where $\delta$ is an amplitude and 
\begin{align}
  T(R) =
  \exp{\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{R-\overline{R}_d}{\Delta
          R_d}\right)^2\right]}, 
\end{align}
where $\overline{R}_d = (R_{d1}+R_{d2})/2$ and $\Delta R_d =
(R_{d2}-R_{d1})/2$. 
\subsection{FARGO 2D}\label{fargo_fiducial}
We consider a disc size $[R_\mathrm{min}, R_\mathrm{max}] =
[0.4,10]R_0$. This gives a total disc mass $M_{d}=0.086M_*$, and the
mass within $R\in[R_{d1},R_{d2}]$ is $0.049M_*$. 
We use a resolution of $N_R\times N_\phi = 512\times 1024$ or
about $8$ grids per $H$, and adopt $\epsilon_g=10^{-4}H$ for the 
self-gravity softening length\footnote{In 2D self-gravity, $\epsilon_g$ also
  approximates for the vertical disc thickness, so a more appropriate
  value would be $\epsilon_g\sim H$ \citep{muller12}. However, because
  $\epsilon_g\propto R$ is needed in FARGO, the Poisson kernel
  (Eq. \ref{2d_grav}) is no longer symmetric in $(R,R^\prime)$. We
  choose a small  
  $\epsilon_g$ in favour of angular momentum conservation, keeping in
  mind that the strength of self-gravity will be over-estimated.}.
Perturbations are set initially with $M=10$ and
$\delta\in[-10^{-3},10^{-3}]$ chosen randomly but does not depend
on $\phi$. 

%set $M=10$ for random perturbations (Eq. \ref{randpert}). 

Snapshots from the disc evolution are shown in Fig. \ref{fargo_2d} in
terms of the non-axisymmetric surface density. At early times
$t\lesssim100P_0$ the disc is dominated by low-amplitude high-$m$
perturbations centred in the dead zone. Eventually a $m=1$ spiral 
grows and dominates inside the dead zone.  

Fig. \ref{fargo_2d_angmom} compares the disc angular momenta
evolution, most of which is contained in the $m=0$ and $m=1$ modes. 
The $m=1$ spiral has an associated negative angular
momentum. Its growth is correlated with an increase in the axisymmetric
component of angular momentum, such that $\Delta J_0 \sim - \Delta
J_1$. Note that FARGO does not explicitly conserve angular
momentum. In addition, there may be an angular momentum flux due to
self-gravity across disc boundaries since our domain size is finite. 
Nevertheless, we find the total angular momentum is conserved to 
$\Delta J = O(10^{-7}J)$, and is much smaller in magnitude than the change in the
angular momenta components, $|\Delta J_m|$. 
Fig. \ref{fargo_2d_angmom} then indicates a transfer of 
angular momentum from the $m=1$ spiral to the background disc.

\subsection{ZEUS-MP 3D}
The 3D disc has radial size 
$[r_\mathrm{min},r_\mathrm{max}]=[0.4,10]R_0$ and vertical extent
$n_H=2$ scale-heights. The resolution is $N_r\times N_\theta\times
N_\phi=256\times32\times256$. Because of the much reduced resolution
compared to 2D, we use a smooth perturbation by setting
$\delta = 10^{-3}$ and $M=1$. This corresponds to a single $m=1$
spiral in the dead zone, which was found to dominate the 2D
simulation. 

Our 3D discs are initialised in approximate equilibrium only, so we
first evolve the disc without perturbations using  
$(\lmax,\mmax)=(32,0)$ up to $t=10P_0$, during which 
meridional velocities are damped out. We then restart the simulation
with the above perturbation and $(\lmax,\mmax)=(32,32)$.
