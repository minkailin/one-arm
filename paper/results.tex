\section{Results for two-dimensional discs}
We first present results from FARGO simulations. The 2D disc spans
$[R_\mathrm{min}, R_\mathrm{max}] = [0.4,10]R_0$. This gives a total
disc mass $M_{d}=0.086M_*$. The mass within
$R\in[R_\mathrm{min},R_{d1}]$ is $0.017M_*$, that within
$R\in[R_{d1},R_{d2}]$ is $0.049M_*$, and that within
$R\in[R_{d2},R_\mathrm{max}]$ is $0.021M_*$. We use a resolution of
$N_R\times N_\phi = 1024\times 2048$, or about $16$ grids per $H$, and
adopt $\epsilon_g=10^{-4}H$ for the   
self-gravity softening length\footnote{In 2D self-gravity, $\epsilon_g$ also
  approximates for the vertical disc thickness, so a more appropriate
  value would be $\epsilon_g\sim H$ \citep{muller12}. However, because
  $\epsilon_g\propto R$ is needed in FARGO, the Poisson kernel
  (Eq. \ref{2d_grav}) is no longer symmetric in $(R,R^\prime)$. We
  choose a small  
  $\epsilon_g$ in favour of angular momentum conservation, keeping in
  mind that the strength of self-gravity will be over-estimated.}.


\subsection{Reference run with random perturbations}
In this fiducial simulation we subject the disc to initial perturbations in
cylindrical radial velocity, 
\begin{align}\label{randpert}
  \frac{\delta v_R}{c_s} = \frac{\delta}{M}\times T(R) \sum_{m=1}^M\cos{m\phi},
\end{align}
where $\delta$ is an amplitude and 
\begin{align}
  T(R) =
  \exp{\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{R-\overline{R}_d}{\Delta
          R_d}\right)^2\right]}, 
\end{align}
where $\overline{R}_d = (R_{d1}+R_{d2})/2$ and $\Delta R_d =
(R_{d2}-R_{d1})/2$. We use $M=10$ and choose
$\delta\in[-10^{-3},10^{-3}]$ randomly but independent of $\phi$. 

Fig. \ref{fargo_modeamp} plots evolution of the maximum
non-axisymmetric surface density amplitudes in $R\in[R_{d1},R_{d2}]$
for $m\in[1,10]$. Snapshots from the simulation are shown in
Fig. \ref{fargo_2d}. 
At early times $t\lesssim100P_0$ the dead zone is
dominated by low-amplitude high-$m$ perturbations. The $m\geq4$ modes
growth initially and saturate (or decays) after $t=40P_0$. Notice the
low $m\leq 2$ modes decay initially, but grows between $t\in[20,40]P_0$,
possibily due to saturation of the high-$m$ modes  
\citep{laughlin96,laughlin97}. However, the $m=1$ mode begins to grow
again after $t=70P_0$, and eventually dominates the dead zone.

Fig. \ref{2d_angmom} shows the disc angular momenta
evolution. Only the $m=0,\,1$ components are 
plotted since they are dominant. The $m=1$ structure has
an associated negative angular momentum.   
Its growth is compensated by an increase in the axisymmetric
component of angular momentum, such that $\Delta J_0 + \Delta
J_1 \sim 0$. Note that FARGO does not conserve angular momentum
exactly. However, we find the total angular momentum varies by 
$|\Delta J/J|= O(10^{-6})$, and is much smaller in magnitude than the
change in the angular momenta components, $|\Delta J_{0,1}/J|>
O(10^{-5})$. Fig. \ref{2d_angmom} then suggest that angular momentum
is transferred from the one-arm spiral to the background disc.
