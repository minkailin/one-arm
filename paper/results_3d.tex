\section{Three-dimensional simulations}\label{results3d}
In this section we review 3D simulations carried 
out using ZEUS-MP and PLUTO. The main purpose is to verify 
the above results with different numerical codes, and validate  
the 2D approximation.    

The 3D disc has radial size
$[r_\mathrm{min},r_\mathrm{max}]=[0.4,10]R_0$ and vertical extent  
$n_H=2$ scale-heights at $R=R_0$. The resolution is $N_r\times N_\theta\times
N_\phi=256\times32\times512$. This corresponds to about $4$ cells per
$H$ in radius. Because of the reduced resolution 
compared to 2D, we use a smooth perturbation by setting
$\delta = 10^{-3}$ and $M=1$ in Eq. \ref{randpert}. This corresponds
to a single $m=1$ disturbance in $R\in[R_1,R_2]$, which
eventually dominates in 2D simulations.  

The 3D discs are initialised in approximate equilibrium only, so we
first evolve the disc without perturbations using  
$(\lmax,\mmax)=(32,0)$ up to $t=10P_0$, during which 
meridional velocities are damped out. We then restart the simulation
with the above perturbation and $(\lmax,\mmax)=(32,32)$, and damp
merdional velocities near the radial boundaries. 

Fig. \ref{3d_ampmax} plots the amplitude of the $m=1$ spirals measured
in the ZEUS-MP and PLUTO runs.

                                %resolution? 
In the ZEUS-MP run we observe disturbances developed near
the inner boundary, which is probably responsible for the initial growth
for $t<70P_0$. This is likely a numerical artifact and effectively seeds
the ZEUS-UP simulation with a larger initial perturbation. Results
from ZEUS-MP are therefore off-set from PLUTO by $\sim50P_0$ However,
once the coherent $m=1$ spiral begins to grow ($t\gtrsim 100P_0$), 
we measure similar growth rates in both codes: 
\begin{align*}
  &\gamma \simeq 0.0073\Omega_k(R_0) \quad\quad \mathrm{PLUTO},\\
  &\gamma \simeq 0.0084\Omega_k(R_0) \quad\quad \varA{ZEUS-MP}.
\end{align*}
Both are smaller than the 2D simulations and due to the
low resolutions adopted and/or the small softening length employed in
2D.  Fig. \ref{3d_ampmax} also show results from strictly isothermal
simulations, which display no growth compared to cases with a 
temperature gradient. This confirms the temperature gradient effect is
the same in 3D.

% isothermal discs ($q=0$).

    ($q=0$) are shown.

Visualisations of the 3D simluations are shown in   
Fig. \ref{3d_prelim} for the disc midplane and near the upper disc
boundary. The snapshots are chosen when the one-armeded spirals in the two codes
have reached similar amplitudes. The agreement between the codes,
as well as with the 2D simulations, is satisfactory. Away from the
disc midplane, a coherent spiral arm is not prominent, but the
disturbance is radially more global, extending up to $R\sim 4R_0$.

\subsection{Vertical structure}
Fig. \ref{3d_rz} shows the vertical structure of the one-armed
spiral in the PLUTO run. The main spiral is confined to $z < H$. Thus,
a 2D disc model, representing dynamics near the disc midplane, 
should be sufficient to study the instability. Interestingly, however, for $R>2R_0$ the
spirals  increase in amplitude away from the midplane. It remains
small in our disc model ($|\Delta\rho| < 0.1$), but could become 
significant with a larger vertical domain. The figure shows that 
the one-armed spiral can have a global influence away from the
midplane of the self-gravitating annulus.

    $\mathrm{max}[\Delta\rho_1(r,\pi/2,\phi)]$. Arrows correspond to the vector 
    $(v_r/R_0,-v_\theta/rh\sin^2{\theta})$. The top (bottom) panel corresponds
    to the inner (outer) portions of the disc. 
    \label{3d_rz}} 
\end{figure}   

Although Fig. \ref{3d_rz} appears to display significant vertical motion,
the three-dimensionality parameter $\Theta < 10^{-2}$
(Eq. \ref{theta}), implying the kinetic energy associated with
vertical motion is insignificant compared to that in horizontal
motion. We find  $|v_z/c_s|\lesssim 
0.2$ for $h=0.05$. Thus, vertical motions are sub-sonic and negligible
compared to horizontal motions, which supports a 2D approximation.

%Vertical velocities
%do increase with the growth of the one-armed spiral, 
%Larger amplitudes

%but we find  $\Theta \lesssim 10^{-2}$.

\subsection{Angular momentum conservation} 
Fig. \ref{3d_angmom} shows the angular momentum evolution in the 3D
runs. ZEUS-MP does not conserve angular momentum very well, but the
variation $|\Delta J/J|< O(10^{-6})$ is small compared 
to the individual components $|\Delta J_{0,1}/J|\sim 
5\times10^{-5}$. The PLUTO run reaches similar values of
$|J_{0,1}|$, but achieves better conservation, with $|\Delta
J/J|=O(10^{-8})$. These plots are again similar to the 2D simulations,
i.e. angular momentum lost by $J_1$ is gained by $J_0$. This confirms 
that the interaction between $J_1$ and $J_0$ operates in 3D and 2D
similarly.
