\section{Three-dimensional simulations}
In this section we briefly review 3D simulations carried 
out using ZEUS-MP and PLUTO. The main purpose is to check 
the above results with different numerical codes, and validate  
the 2D approximation.    

The 3D disc has radial size
$[r_\mathrm{min},r_\mathrm{max}]=[0.4,10]R_0$ and vertical extent 
$n_H=2$ scale-heights. The resolution is $N_r\times N_\theta\times
N_\phi=256\times32\times256$. This corresponds to about $4$ cells per
$H$in radius. 
Because of the much reduced resolution 
compared to 2D, we use a smooth perturbation by setting
$\delta = 10^{-3}$ and $M=1$ in Eq. \ref{randpert}. This corresponds
to a single $m=1$ disturbance in $R\in[R_1,R_2]$, which was found to dominate
the 2D simulation.  

Our 3D discs are initialised in approximate equilibrium only, so we
first evolve the disc without perturbations using  
$(\lmax,\mmax)=(32,0)$ up to $t=100P_0$, during which 
meridional velocities are damped out. We then restart the simulation
with the above perturbation and $(\lmax,\mmax)=(32,32)$. 


Fig. \ref{3d_ampmax} plots the amplitude of the $m=1$ spirals measured
in the ZEUS-MP and PLUTO runs. We also show results from strictly
isothermal discs ($q=0$), which clearly display no growth. %why no high m
                                %modes as in 2D for iso disc?
                                %resolution?
Results from ZEUS-MP appears to be off-set from that obtained using
PLUTO. We suspect this may be due to larger numerical noise in the
ZEUS-MP code. Thus the $m=1$ spiral grows to a larger amplitude by the
end of the run. However, we measure similar growth rates,
\begin{align*}
&\gamma \simeq 0.0073\Omega_k(R_0) \quad\quad \mathrm{PLUTO},\\
&\gamma \simeq 0.0075\Omega_k(R_0) \quad\quad \varA{ZEUS-MP}.
\end{align*}
Both are smaller than the 2D simulations above. This may be due to the
low resolutions adopted.

\end{figure}

Visualisations of the 3D simluations are shown in
Fig. \ref{3d_prelim} for the disc midplane and near the upper disc
boundary. The snapshots are chosen when the spiral 
amplitudes reached in the two codes are similar. Although the
non-axisymmetric density has similar amplitudes at both heights, a
coherent spiral is less evident away from the disc midplane. 
The agreement between the two codes, as well as with the 2D
simulations, is satisfactory.

    \equiv \pi/2 - \theta$ is the angular height  
    from the midplane.\label{3d_prelim}}

\subsection{Vertical motion}
We measure three-dimensionality using the parameter $\Theta$ as
defined in Eq. \ref{theta}.  Vertical velocities
do increase with the growth of the one-arm spiral, 
%Larger amplitudes
%are reached in ZEUS because of larger numerical noise. 
but we find  $\Theta \lesssim 10^{-2}$. This implies $|v_z/c_s|\lesssim
0.2$ for $h=0.05$. Thus, vertical motions are sub-sonic and negligible
compared to horizontal motions. This supports the 2D approximation.

\subsection{Angular momentum evolution}

Fig. \ref{3d_angmom} shows the angular momentum evolution in the 3D
runs. ZEUS-MP does not conserve angular momentum very well, but
the variation $|\Delta J/J|< O(10^{-5})$ is not significant compared
to the individual components $|\Delta J_{0,1}/J|\sim 
6\times10^{-5}$. The PLUTO run reaches similar values of
$|J_{0,1}|$, but achieves better conervation, with $|\Delta
J/J|=O(10^{-8})$.

    $J_\mathrm{ref}$.\label{3d_angmom}}
